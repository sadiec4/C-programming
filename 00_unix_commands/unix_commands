1. mkdr <directory_name> (make directory). Creates a folder

2. cd <directory_name> (change directoy). changes current directory to the specified one

4. ls (list). Shos the context of the current directory

5. pwd (print working directory). shows path of current directory

6. clear - clears the terminal window

7. gcc <file_name (c source code)> - compile the program

8. ./executable_file> - runs program

9. \ - escape

10. \* - escape sequence

11. \n - new line

12. <stdio.h> 

13. main(void). void represents no data, same as ()
        doesnt provide with info

15. Errors; if it does not compile it is likely a syntax error (easiest fix).
        --> error while running program are called runtime errors
        --> Logic errors allow programs to completion, but often produce incorrect results (most difficult to fix).

16. printing numbers/integers: printf("%d,named variable integer"). %d is a conversion specifier

17. scanf("%d"): only conversion specifiers inside 
        use teh "and sign" &, is it the address operator
